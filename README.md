# DKT - Group project

This repository features the game DKT, for which an android application has been created in the group phase of the Software Engineering II course. While each group pick a desired game, some requirements had to be met, which were as follows:

- multi-player
- server has to run on one of the clients
- cheat functionality
- use of sensors
- must a bit complex, thus not games like *Uno*, *Schlangen und Leitern* or *Mensch Ã„rgere dich nicht*

Based on these prerequisites, all members agreed on DKT.

## Proceedings

As part of this group phase a game had to be developed using [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/). This means that the development has been split into 3 segments or so called sprints. The goal was to assign tasks to each member, for each sprint, that had to be finished at the of the sprint. Applying this strategy to all 3 sprints should result in a finished game.

### Sprint Tasks

In order to reduce merge-conflicts at the end of a sprint, we as a group tried to define tasks that are independent from each other. As a result we focussed on the basics of the game first, such as the logic-class-structure, server, client and the UI at first.

In the second sprint we defined specific features to each member, such as charging rent, buying a property, moving on the map, join a game and enter the game from the lobby. Note that, each feature involved all three layers of the app. That means, as part of a feature, one had to work on the server and client side as well as the UI.

Finally, in the third sprint our focus was set on the implementation of missing features, optimization and bug fixes. This involved features like, action cards, leaving the game, cheating functionalities, round/time limit, multi-language support.
