# DKT - Group project

This repository features the game DKT, for which an android application has been created in the group phase of the Software Engineering II course. While each group pick a desired game, some requirements had to be met, which were as follows:

- multi-player
- server has to run on one of the clients
- cheat functionality
- use of sensors
- must a bit complex, thus not games like *Uno*, *Schlangen und Leitern* or *Mensch Ã„rgere dich nicht*

Based on these prerequisites, all members agreed on DKT.
