# DKT - Group project

This repository features the game DKT, for which an android application has been created in the group phase of the Software Engineering II course. While each group pick a desired game, some requirements had to be met, which were as follows:

- multi-player
- server has to run on one of the clients
- cheat functionality
- use of sensors
- must a bit complex, thus not games like *Uno*, *Schlangen und Leitern* or *Mensch Ã„rgere dich nicht*

Based on these prerequisites, all members agreed on DKT.

## Proceedings

As part of this group phase a game had to be developed using [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/). This means that the development has been split into 3 segments or so called sprints. The goal was to assign tasks to each member, for each sprint, that had to be finished at the of the sprint. Applying this strategy to all 3 sprints should result in a finished game.
