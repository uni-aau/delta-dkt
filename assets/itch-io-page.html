<h2>DKT - Group project</h2>
<p>
  This repository features the game DKT, for which an android application has
  been created in the group phase of the Software Engineering II course. While
  each group pick a desired game, some requirements had to be met, which were as
  follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-Player</li>
  <li>Server runs on one clients</li>
  <li>Cheat Functionality</li>
  <li>Sensors</li>
  <li>A game that is somewhat complex <br><s>Uno</s>, <s>Schlangen und Leitern</s></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these prerequisites, all members agreed on DKT.</p>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>
  As part of this group phase a game had to be developed using
  <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">SCRUM</a>. This means that the development has been
  split into 3 segments or so-called sprints. The goal was to assign tasks to
  each member, for each sprint, that had to be finished at the of the sprint.
  Applying this strategy to all 3 sprints should result in a finished game.
</p>
<h2>Sprint Tasks</h2>
<p>
  In order to reduce merge-conflicts at the end of a sprint, we as a group tried
  to define tasks that are independent of each other. As a result we focussed
  on the basics of the game first, such as the logic-class-structure, server,
  client and the UI at first.
</p>
<p>
  In the second sprint we defined specific features to each member, such as
  charging rent, buying a property, moving on the map, join a game and enter the
  game from the lobby. Note that, each feature involved all three layers of the
  app. That means, as part of a feature, one had to work on the server and
  client side as well as the UI.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, in the third sprint our focus was set on the implementation of
  missing features, optimization and bug fixes. This involved features like,
  action cards, leaving the game, cheating functionalities, round/time limit,
  multi-language support.
</p>
<h2>Project Metrics</h2>
<p>
  This chapter shows the project metrics, which are generated by <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/">SonarCloud</a>. They are updatically updated by sonarcloud when the master branch is updated.

<h1>Features of the game</h1>
<p>
  When the game is started a player nickname must be entered to continue with
  the game. Once a valid nickname is entered and the button is pressed the
  MainMenu will be shown.
</p>
<p>
  <img style="margin-left: 37%; width: 25%; border-radius: 24px;"  src="https://github.com/uni-aau/delta-dkt/blob/master/assets/MainActivity.png?raw=true" alt="Main Activity">
</p>

<hr>
<p>
  In this menu the player can choose whether he wants to host a new game or join an existing game in his current network.
</p>

<p>
  <img style="margin-left: 37%; width: 25%; border-radius: 24px;"  src="https://github.com/uni-aau/delta-dkt/blob/master/assets/MainMenu.png?raw=true" alt="Host Game - Menu"/>
</p>

<h2>Joining existing game</h2>
<p>
  For this to work a game has to be hosted by another player that is on the same
  network as the player that wants to join a game. If those requirements are
  met, then all available game servers will be shown in a list. Then one of the
  servers can be selected by clicking on it. Once a selection has been made the
  player is able to press the Join button at the bottom right corner. Pressing
  the Join button will connect to the server as a client and show a new activity
  / screen, called the LobbyView.
</p>
<h2>Host a new game</h2>
<p>
  In order to host a new game, the ‘Host Game’ button is to be pressed. After
  the button has been pressed a new dialog will pop up, that will ask the user
  to configure the game server. The options include the server name, max. amount
  of players allowed, whether the game is to be timed either by rounds or time
  spent and the amount of rounds or minutes until the game is finished by the
  system. Once the parameters have been entered the server can be started and
  the screen could like this:
</p>

</div>


<h2>Game Lobby</h2>
<p>
  Hosting a new game server will update the players view so that he is the
  Lobby. Whenever a new player joins a server the view of each player will be
  updated so that all the players of a game are inside the Lobby. Each player,
  even the host of the game, is able to leave the lobby at all times. In case a
  players leaves the view of the others will be simply updated, so that the
  player, who left, is no longer displayed. However, if the hosts decides to
  leave and therefore decides to abandon the lobby, will close the lobby, thus
  move all the players back to the MainMenu of the game.
</p>
<p>
  The host has the option to start the game at any time by clicking on the Start
  button in the bottom right-hand corner while waiting until the number of
  players is reached. When this button is clicked, the view of each player is
  updated so that each player is in the so-called GameView.
</p>

<img style="margin-left: 37%; width: 25%; border-radius: 24px;"  src="https://github.com/uni-aau/delta-dkt/blob/master/assets/LobbyView.png?raw=true" alt="LobbyView"/>

<h2>GameView</h2>
<p>
  The game is played within the GameView. As part of the game, players can roll
  the dice to make a move, buy properties and pay rent to property owners. Note
  that only the host is able to roll the dice at the beginning of the game. When
  he finishes his turn, the turn of the next player begins. This cycle continues
  until either there is only one player left or until the round or time limit is
  reached.
</p>
<p>
  <img style="margin-left: 15%; width: 70%; border-radius: 24px;"  src="https://github.com/uni-aau/delta-dkt/blob/master/assets/GameView.png?raw=true" alt="GameView"/>
</p>
<h3>Player Timeout - Kicked from Game</h3>
<p>
  It is also important to know that if a player does not complete his turn
  within a given time of currently 20 seconds, he will be informed of this and
  removed from the game if he continues to wait. In this case, the next player
  takes his turn.
</p>
<h3>Cheating</h3>
<p>
  During the game, each player has the opportunity to gain an advantage by
  cheating. This can be done by a player covering his light senor of the device
  and then rolling the dice. By doing so, this player activates cheating for his
  turn and receives an enhanced dice that rolls a number between 7 and 9.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/7420/7420980.png" style="height: 14px;" alt="Note!"> However, it should be noted that each player has the option to report other
  players at any time if he believes that a player has cheated.
</p>
<p>
  Players can do this by pressing the "Report Cheater" button, which opens a
  dialogue.
</p>
<p>
  <img style="margin-left: 30%; width: 40%; border-radius: 24px;"  src="https://github.com/uni-aau/delta-dkt/blob/master/assets/ReportCheater.png?raw=true" alt="Report Cheat Menu"/>
</p>
<p>
  In this dialogue, a player may select another player from the list to report.
  Please note that you will lose $200 if you falsely report a player, whereas a
  player who is caught cheating will lose $500.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Alternatively, this menu can also be closed again without reporting a player.
</p>
<h3>Losing</h3>
<p>
  Should a player not be able to pay a rent or the fine for cheating or
  something like that, because he does not have enough money at hand, he loses
  and can no longer participate in the game. When a player loses, all the
  properties are returned to the bank and can be bought by other players.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  At the end of a game, each player sees a ranking list of the players, sorted
  by their wealth.
